# About Magnality
Magnality was intended as a way to facilitate information sharing across a wide range of topics, in an organized manner. The organization is handled by all users so it's a group effort to participate in creating a better community.

This site was developed using [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) and their licence agreement applies to all items not found in /models, /views or /controllers. For that code, you may use any part you wish without any attribution to myself.
